## Installation

- Install [ROS 2 Jazzy](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation.html) for Ubuntu 24.04
- Clone this repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ycheng517/ar4_ros_driver
  ```
- Install workspace dependencies:
  ```bash
  rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src -r -y
  ```
- Build the workspace:
  ```bash
  colcon build
  ```
- Source the workspace:
  ```bash
  source install/setup.bash
  ```
- Enable serial port access if you haven't already done so:
  ```bash
  sudo addgroup $USER dialout
  ```
  You will need to log out and back in for changes to take effect.

### Firmware Flashing

The Teensy and Arduino Nano sketches provided in [annin_ar4_firmware](./annin_ar4_firmware/)
are compatible with the default hardware. To flash it, follow the same
procedure as specified in [AR4 Robot Setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL6lXu8VU4s).
An extra step required is to install [Bounce2](https://github.com/thomasfredericks/Bounce2)
from the Library Manager in Arduino.

### [Optional] Running in Docker Container

A docker container and run script has been provided that can be used to run the
robot and any GUI programs. It requires [rocker](https://github.com/osrf/rocker) to be installed. Then you can start the docker container with:

```bash
docker build -t ar4_ros_driver .

# Adjust the volume mounting and devices based on your project and hardware
rocker --ssh --x11 \
  --devices /dev/ttyUSB0 /ttyACM0 \
  --volume $(pwd):/ar4_ws/src/ar4_ros_driver -- \
  ar4_ros_driver bash
```

## Usage

There are two modules that you will always need to run:

1. **Arm module** - this can be for either a real-world or simulated arm

   - For controlling the real-world arm, you will need to run the `annin_ar4_driver` module
   - For the simulated arm, you will need to run the `annin_ar4_gazebo` module
   - Either of the modules will load the necessary hardware descriptions for MoveIt

2. **MoveIt module** - the `annin_ar4_moveit_config` module provides the MoveIt interface and RViz GUI.

The various use cases of the modules and instructions to run them are described below:

---

### MoveIt Demo in RViz

If you are unfamiliar with MoveIt, it is recommended to start with this to explore planning with MoveIt in RViz. This contains neither a real-world nor a simulated arm but just a model loaded within RViz for visualisation.

The robot description, moveit interface and RViz will all be loaded in the single demo launch file

```bash
ros2 launch annin_ar4_moveit_config demo.launch.py
```

---

### Control real-world arm with MoveIt in RViz

Start the `annin_ar4_driver` module, which will load configs and the robot description:

```bash
ros2 launch annin_ar4_driver driver.launch.py calibrate:=True
```

Available Launch Arguments:

- `ar_model`: The model of the AR4. Options are `mk1`, `mk2`, or `mk3`. Defaults to `mk3`.
- `calibrate`: Whether to calibrate the robot arm (determine the absolute position
  of each joint).
- `include_gripper`: Whether to include the servo gripper. Defaults to: `include_gripper:=True`.
- `serial_port`: Serial port of the Teensy board. Defaults to: `serial_port:=/dev/ttyACM0`.
- `arduino_serial_port`: Serial port of the Arduino Nano board. Defaults to `arduino_serial_port:=/dev/ttyUSB0`.

‚ö†Ô∏èüìè Note: Calibration is required after flashing firmware to the Teensy board, and
power cycling the robot and/or the Teensy board. It can be skipped in subsequent
runs with `calibrate:=False`.

Start MoveIt and RViz:

```bash
ros2 launch annin_ar4_moveit_config moveit.launch.py
```

Available Launch Arguments:

- `ar_model`: The model of the AR4. Options are `mk1`, `mk2`, or `mk3`. Defaults to `mk3`.
- `include_gripper`: Whether to include the servo gripper. Defaults to:
  `include_gripper:=True`.
- `use_sim_time`: Make Moveit use simulation time. Should only be enabled when
  running with Gazebo. Defaults to: `use_sim_time:=False`.

You can now plan in RViz and control the real-world arm. Joint commands and joint states will be updated through the hardware interface.

NOTE: At any point you may interrupt the robot movement by pressing the E-Stop button
on the robot. This would abruptly stop the robot motion! To reset the E-Stop state of
the robot use the following command

```bash
ros2 run annin_ar4_driver reset_estop.sh <AR_MODEL>
```

where `<AR_MODEL>` is the model of the AR4, one of `mk1`, `mk2`, or `mk3`

---

### Control simulated arm in Gazebo with MoveIt in RViz

Start the `annin_ar4_gazebo` module, which will start the Gazebo simulator and load the robot description.

```bash
ros2 launch annin_ar4_gazebo gazebo.launch.py
```

Start Moveit and RViz:

```bash
ros2 launch annin_ar4_moveit_config moveit.launch.py use_sim_time:=true include_gripper:=True
```

You can now plan in RViz and control the simulated arm.

## Tuning and Tweaks

### Tuning Joint Offsets

If for some reason your robot's joint positions appear misaligned after moving
to the home position, you can adjust the joint offsets in the
[joint_offsets/](./annin_ar4_driver/config/joint_offsets/) config folder.
Select and modify the YAML file corresponding to your AR model to fine-tune the joint positions.

### Switching to Position Control

By default this repo uses velocity-based joint trajectory control. It allows the arm to move a lot faster and the arm movement is also a lot smoother. If for any
reason you'd like to use the simpler classic position-only control mode, you can
set `velocity_control_enabled: false` in [driver.yaml](./annin_ar4_driver/config/driver.yaml). Note that you'll need to reduce velocity and acceleration scaling in order for larger motions to succeed.

### Gripper Overcurrent Protection

See the [Gripper Overcurrent Protection](./docs/gripper_overcurrent_protection.md) page.
